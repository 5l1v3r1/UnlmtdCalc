UnlmtdCalc
==========

A python application that takes the Value of a Cineworld Unlimited card and then works out if it's worth while you getting one based upon your film choices if it's worth seeing the films individually or worth getting a pass

Plans for the application as a whole:

What Does it Do?
1. How Many films you'd need to go and see in a year to get your money's worth

2. Asks you what films you want to see and then works out if you'd be cheaper off getting a card

3. prints out how much x amount of films will cost you

4. prints out savings from getting a card(based upon a 12 Month Membership) then lets you know how many more films you'd need to see to get money's worth
 
Future Plans: 
API calls, Personalisaton, A menu system, possibility of porting to a mobile platform(Android maybe?), Potentially other cinema apps like Vue and Odeon too


Feel Free to Pull down the app tear apart the code and do what you want with it :)

Changes in 0.02, tell the user how many more films they need to see to get money's worth after cost of films in list
This application is in no way affiliated with Cineworld Cinemas and has been created by Andrew Gill for a learning python project
