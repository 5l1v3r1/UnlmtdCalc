UnlmtdCalc
==========

A python application that takes the Value of a Cineworld Unlimited card and then works out if it's worth while you getting one based upon your film choices if it's worth seeing the films individually or worth getting a pass

Plans for the application as a whole:

What Does it Do?
1. How Many films you'd need to go and see in a year to get your money's worth (Partially Completed)

2. Asks you what films you want to see and then works out if you'd be cheaper off getting a card(In progress)

3. prints out how much x amount of films will cost you

4. prints out savings from getting a card(based upon a 12 Month Membership)
 
Future Plans: 
API calls, Personalisaton, A menu system, possibility of porting to a mobile platform(Android maybe?), Potentially other cinema apps like Vue and Odeon too


Feel Free to Pull down the app tear apart the code and do what you want with it :)
